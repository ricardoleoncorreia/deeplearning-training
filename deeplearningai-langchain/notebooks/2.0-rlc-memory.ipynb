    "In previous version, the following memory classes were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ConversationBufferMemory:** allows for storing of messages and then extract them in a variable.\n",
    "* **ConversationBufferWindowMemory:** keeps a list of the interaction of the conversation over tim. It uses the last K interactions.\n",
    "* **ConversationTokenBufferMemory:** keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush.\n",
    "* **ConversationSummaryMemory:** creates a summary of the conversation over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also it supports vector and entity memory and can use multiple memories like Conversational + Entity (to recall individuals).\n",
