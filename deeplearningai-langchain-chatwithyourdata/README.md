# LangChain: Chat with Your Data

## Introduction

This project is based on DeepLearning.AI's comprehensive [LangChain: Chat with Your Data](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/) course. It provides hands-on experience with building conversational AI systems that can interact with and retrieve information from your own documents and data sources.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your macOS system. You can check by running:
```bash
python3 --version
```

For conda environments, make sure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed:
```bash
conda --version
```

## Environment Setup

### Creating a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Using conda
conda create --name deeplearningai-langchain-chatwithyourdata python=3.13
```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

```bash
# Activate the conda environment
conda activate deeplearningai-langchain-chatwithyourdata
```

## Course Modules

This project covers the following key areas of building chat systems with your data:

1. **Document Loading** - Loading documents from various sources (PDFs, text files, web pages, etc.)
2. **Document Splitting** - Breaking down large documents into manageable chunks for processing
3. **Vector Stores and Embeddings** - Converting text to vector representations and storing them efficiently
4. **Retrieval** - Finding relevant document chunks based on user queries
5. **Question Answering** - Generating answers based on retrieved document content
6. **Chat** - Building conversational interfaces that maintain context and memory

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install from environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate deeplearningai-langchain-chatwithyourdata
```

## Best Practices

1. **Chunk Size Optimization** - Experiment with different chunk sizes based on your document type
2. **Embedding Model Selection** - Choose embeddings that work well with your domain
3. **Vector Store Persistence** - Always persist your vector stores to avoid recomputation
4. **Memory Management** - Implement appropriate memory strategies for long conversations
5. **Source Attribution** - Always return source documents for transparency
6. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error handling for document loading and processing
7. **Performance Monitoring** - Monitor retrieval quality and response times
8. **Security** - Sanitize user inputs and protect sensitive document content
